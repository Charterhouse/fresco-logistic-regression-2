Logistic Regression prototype using FRESCO
==========================================

A prototype for implementing [Logistic Regression][1] in the [FRESCO][2]
framework. This uses [Secure Multi-Party Computation][3] to calculate a logistic
regression on a combination of data sets from multiple parties, without
disclosing the data sets between parties.

Getting Started
---------------

The simplest way to get started is by running the `run.sh` script. When called
without arguments, it will print information on how to use it.

This project was developed using (and contains project files for) IntelliJ IDEA.
